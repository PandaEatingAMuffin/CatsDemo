                    <ol>
                        <li> They shouldn't eat bamboo </li>
                        <li> They are really picky with which pandas they want to cuddle with which isn't helping in creating more baby pandas</li>
                        <li> When they're big, they're also quite chonky which makes it harder for them to move</li>
                        <li> They're stereotyped to know kong fu, but they don't. This causes unfortunate misunderstandings.</li>
                        <li> They don't have telepathic abilities (work in progress)</li>
                        <li> Big chonkers contribute to the total of Earth's mass by 50%, so panda space travel will be difficult to figure out</li>
